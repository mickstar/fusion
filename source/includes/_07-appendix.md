## ProtocolVersion updates from 3.1 to 3.1-dmg

The DataMesh API supports two versions. 
- "3.1" is based on the Nexo 3.1 standard
- "3.1-dmg" is "3.1" with additional fields added by DataMesh which are outside the Nexo standard (e.g. surcharge)

Breaking changes when moving from "3.1" to "3.1-dmg"

- [MessageHeader.ProtocolVersion](#data-dictionary-protocolversion) should be set to "3.1-dmg"
- Tip amount is now present in [PaymentResponse.PaymentResult.AmountsResp.TipAmount](#tipamount).
- Surchage amount is now present in [PaymentResponse.PaymentResult.AmountsResp.SurchargeAmount](#surchargeamount).
- `PaymentResponse.PaymentResult.PaymentReceipt` is now an array of receipts. This was a single object in "3.1"
- For a successful payment, the acquirer STAN is returned in `PaymentResponse.PaymentResult.PaymentAcquirerData.STAN`. 
- For a successful payment, the acquirer RRN is returned in `PaymentResponse.PaymentResult.PaymentAcquirerData.RRN`. 
- POS should support the "3.1-dmg" `mandatory features checklist`
  - Support for [purchase](#cloud-api-reference-perform-a-purchase) and [refund](#cloud-api-reference-perform-a-refund) payment types
  - Include [product data](#cloud-api-reference-product-data) in each payment request
  - Additional fields will be added to the message specification over time. To ensure forwards compatibility the Sale System must ignore when extra objects and fields are present in response messages. This includes valid MAC handling in the SecurityTrailer.
  - Support for TLS and other [security requirements](#cloud-api-reference-security-requirements)
  - [Settings user interface](#settings-user-interface)
  - [Payments user interface](#payment-user-interface) which handles the `Initial UI`, `Final UI`, and `cancelling a sale in progress`

  - Ensure Sale System provides a unique [payment identification](#payment-identification)
